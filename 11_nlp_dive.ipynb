    "Looking at the code for our RNN, one thing that seems problematic is that we are initialising our hidden state to zero for every new input sequence. Why is that a problem? We made our sample sequences short so they would fit easily into batches. But if we order those samples correctly, those sample sequences will be read in order by the model, exposing the model to long stretches of the original sequence. \n",

    "But because we initialize the model's hidden state to zero for each new sample, we are throwing away all the information we have about the sentences we have seen so far, which means that our model doesn't actually know where we are up to in the overall counting sequence. This is easily fixed; we can simply move the initialisation of the hidden state to `__init__`.\n",

When we talk about the representation of a recurrent neural network before refactoring with the for loop, we call this the *unrolled representation*. It is often helpful to consider the unrolled representation when trying to understand an RNN.\n",

If you run it a few times, you'll see that you can get quite different results on different runs. That's because effectively we have a very deep network here, which can result in very large or very small gradients. We'll see in the next chapter how to resolve this, by using the `LSTM` architecture.\n",
